			These ETFs, along with other foreign securities, have been approved for

		<p class="how-to-invest-to-etf-paragraph">
			Investing in ETFs is similar to investing in stocks of industry giants
			like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Bank of America, or Tesla. To buy shares of an
			ETF, you need an open brokerage account and access to the exchanges where
			ETF shares are traded. You can also purchase ETFs on the over-the-counter
			market if you have a counterparty seller and want to make a direct
			transaction.
		</p>
		<p class="how-to-invest-to-etf-paragraph">
			Before the large-scale war with Russia, BTC Broker provided access to U.S.
			stock exchanges as a sub-broker through its foreign partner broker.
			Currently, this service is temporarily unavailable due to NBU currency
			restrictions during martial law.
		</p>
		<p class="how-to-invest-to-etf-paragraph">
			On domestic stock exchanges and the over-the-counter market, you can buy
			ETFs only if another domestic investor decides to sell them. As a result,
			the supply of American issuer securities for sale in the internal market
			is almost nonexistent.
